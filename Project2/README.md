#Niji-Mini-Games
 Artist Satement

 The goal of this project was to make multiple mini-games. The mini-game would be easy to understand, play and navigate between them. In addition, it should also have a pleasing UI and assets to interact with.

The mini-games are themed around v-tubers from Nijisanji. The user doesn't have to explicitly know them to understand how to play the game. The only difference if you know them is that there might be jokes, that will be even funnier to the fans.

My goal for the project to be aesthetically pleasing is fulfill by the assets used. I have chosen assets that represent well the games and what the user is looking at. These assets also play into the Ui that I have designed to be clear and easy to navigate. I have also implemented a music selector to allow the user to choose music that they like, adding to the experience.

On the technical part, I had a harder time with it. I could not understand well enough object-oriented programing. So I could not implement it into my coding. I have used arrays a lot to keep track of multiple objects when it could have been too many variables. I have also used the Audio library of p5 during one of the games. I have used many functions to identify well what part of the project they take care of.
